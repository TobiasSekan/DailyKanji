# Goals

#### Next
* Add test type for Roomaji to Katakana or Hiragana
* Add menu entry to reset the statistics
* Add new answers sub-menu (show current answer inside menu entry with shortcut)
* Recalculate buttons (button width), when window is resized
* Visible timer in 0.1 second (can be deactivated via menu)

#### Near future
* Prevent double-click and multi-click on correct answers to avoid wrong next answer
  * Note: Prevent it direct inside the command handlers
* On similar answers, in some circumstance it is easy to direct find the correct answer, we need a prevention for this 
  * Maybe: Only the first character or last character must are the same on less then five answers
* TODO: Export (XLSX, CSV, JSON, XML)

#### Later
* Change test order so that all tests will be ask (based on ask counter)
* Make colours choose-able

#### Ideas
* Import (XLSX, CSV, JSON, XML)
